# Case Studies

Althea networks can be set up by anyone, anywhere. We work with _Subnet Organizers_ all over the world to help them set up networks from scratch: from finding the right source of bandwidth, to setting up and optimizing equipment, through finding new users and rallying their community around the cause. No two networks are the same, as each is built from the ground up to meet the unique needs of the area.

Our routing protocol makes it easy to manage these networks once they're up and running. With automated usage monitoring, billing and payments, organizers can focus on growing and improving these networks, instead of drowning in administrative needs. We're excited about our first deployments—if you're interested in starting one in your community, please _get in touch_!

## CASE STUDY: MEDELLIN

##### ::Something snappy and interesting here::

In many parts of Medellin, internet connections are spotty, slow, expensive, or non-existent. The _subnet organizers_ at _Red_medellin_ are deploying their first Althea network in a hillside community, where a small number of high-speed, line-of-sight connections can bring better bandwidth to homes, schools, and businesses.

#### Legacy ISP: Slow or No Bandwidth

The few ISPs active in Medellin [charge high rates](https://qz.com/198988/colombian-internet-is-some-expensive-internet/) leaving many residential areas with no way to buy adequate speed at a fair price.

#### Althea: Faster, Cheaper Internet— Owned by the people using it

The [red_medellin]() _subnet DAO_ is bringing internet access to Comuna 13, partnering with another local organization to buy bandwidth, and beaming it by radio to the neighborhood. While some nodes on the network will just be accessing the internet, others can help grow the network organically by getting their neighbors set up too—offsetting the cost of their own connection, or even earning a little money doing so.

## Technology & Topology

#### Gateway node

It's not possible to buy adequate speed within the community because <<why>>, so Red_medellin has partnered with local recording studio Son Bata to buy commercial bandwidth and beam it to Communa 13. This connection will travel 1.6km by point-to-point radio to a school that sits on a hill above the neighborhood, with a great line of sight to many of the houses and buildings nearby.

#### Intermediary Nodes

Any houses with a direct view of the school can point an inexpensive antenna to the sector antennas set up above the school and connect to the internet. These houses can then “pass on” this connection to their neighbors via ethernet cable, earning some money. Communa 13 has dense construction, making connecting over ethernet easy.

#### End Users

Users access bandwidth through Intermediary Nodes, or directly from the Gateway Node, and don't pass it on to anyone else... yet. Anytime they want to, these users could become Intermediary Nodes by connecting to their neighbors who don't yet have access.
