     <p style="max-width: 500px">Today, internet access networks are owned by centralized, usually monopolistic ISPs. The ISP owns all the routers and networking hardware, and charges for their use with a monthly fee. In most areas, there are only one or two options. If you don't like their rates or their service, there isn't much you can do about it. Competing with them would involve starting your own ISP, large enough to be a self sustaining business — which isn't a feasible option for most.</p>

   <div class="col-6">
     <p style="max-width: 500px">
      Althea makes this possible. Our team supports the creation of new networks built by and for communities, powered by our routers which pay each other for bandwidth. This allows people to set up “decentralized ISPs” in their communities, and easily manage and grow them. We're working with communities all over the world to set up test deployments of our routers now, and are looking for partners and collaborators interested in setting up their own. If this is you, see the Get Involved section to get in touch.
